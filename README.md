 As a  new data engineer at a company, my first major task is to conduct research on the company's employees during the 1980s and 1990s.
 Six CSV files remain from the employee database from that period.

For this project, I design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. That is, I perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.
